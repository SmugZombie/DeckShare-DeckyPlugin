# DeckShare - Discord Powered Screenshot Uploader

DeckShare is a simple DeckyLoader plugin that monitors SteamOS for new screenshots using a hook and automatically posts them to Discord via the provided webhook. (You must get your own [Discord webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) url and provide it to the plugin upon first time setup)
